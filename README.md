### My story
I've been obsessed with computers and technology for as long as I can remember, practically since birth. My parents love to tell stories about how I was playing Flash games on a computer before I was even a year old.

My introduction to programming came from my dad, [@ontehfritz](https://github.com/ontehfritz), a fellow developer and my biggest inspiration. When I was around eight years old, he introduced me to my first C# Console application, teaching me the basics of inputting and outputting text via the console. That moment sparked a lifelong passion for programming.

Many years of self-learning later, countless hours of trial & error, late night debugging, and hundreds of hobby projects, I've garnered a deep understanding for the world of software development. What started out as writing simple console applications, gradually evolved into developing full stack web and desktop applications, game modifications, AI-driven tools, and much more.

Since 2023, I've been receiving freelance contract offers to develop custom software for a wide array of clients, steadily growing my experience through completing these projects. If you have a project or even just want to chat about programming, feel free to get in touch with me!
